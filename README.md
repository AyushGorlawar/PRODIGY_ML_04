# PRODIGY_ML_04
# Hand Gesture Recognition Model

This project develops a hand gesture recognition model using a dataset of hand gestures. The model can be used for intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

## Directory Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model creation, and inference.
- `saved_models/`: Directory to save trained models.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project description.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Unzip the dataset into the `data/` directory.

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training.

4. Use the scripts in `src/` for data preprocessing, model creation, and inference.

## Dataset

Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog) and unzip it into the `data/` directory.
